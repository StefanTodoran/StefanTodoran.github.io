            My first foray into web design started in 2019 shortly after first learning to code, when I built a website

            attract customers to my mom's business, the site attracted the attention of many of her colleagues and other
            local business owners and before I knew it I had requests coming in from all over!

            programming, it is also an opportunity to support local businesses which might find other website services to
            be both prohibitively expensive and lacking sufficient customization to warrant their price.
